# Old blog in Jekyll

This repository hosts the code of my blog from the days (2016, to be exact) when I used to use Jekyll as the SSG. Since then I have experimented with Pelican, and Hugo, before finally settling with Hugo. My current personal blog is hosted at [yashagarwal.in](https://yashagarwal.in/), and the code can be seen at [https://github.com/yashhere/yashhere.github.io](https://github.com/yashhere/yashhere.github.io).

If you are interested in how this site looks in a browser, I have a live version available at [https://jekyll.yashagarwal.in/](https://jekyll.yashagarwal.in/). Do not expect to see everything working. Thankfully the site builds just fine in 2020 also. However, there might be some stuff that might not work. For example, icons are not displayed correctly.

Feel free to fork it if you like the design.
